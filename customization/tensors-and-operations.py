# A Tensor is a multi-dimensional array. 
# Similar to NumPy ndarray objects, tf.
# Tensor objects have a data type and a shape. 
# Additionally, tf.Tensors can reside in accelerator memory (like a GPU). 
# TensorFlow offers a rich library of operations 
# (tf.add, tf.matmul, tf.linalg.inv etc.) that consume and produce tf.Tensors.

# are assigned (placed on) a device for execution. 
# As mentioned, when there is no explicit guidance provided,

# and copies tensors to that device, if needed. 
# However, TensorFlow operations can be explicitly placed 
# on specific devices using the tf.device context manager
